name: code-design
description: Code design directives to apply by default whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring code — covers self-documenting code (no comments), naming, flat control flow (guard clauses / max 2 levels of nesting), composition over inheritance, dependency injection, avoiding premature optimization, avoiding over-abstraction, and pragmatism over paradigms. Use when the user asks to write, review, clean up, or refactor code, or to check a change against design/style guidelines.

# Code Design Directives

These rules apply to every task that involves writing, reviewing, or refactoring code.
They must be followed by default, unless the project context explicitly states otherwise.

---

## 1. Don't write comments

- If you need a comment to explain what the code does, refactor the code until it explains
  itself. A comment is a signal of poor design, not good documentation.
- Comments lie over time: code gets updated, comments don't. Avoid desynchronized
  documentation debt.
- Never use comments to track changes or history. That's what git is for. A well-written
  commit message replaces any history comment in the code.
- Replace every "magic number" with a named constant that explains what the value represents:
  not `if (status === 3)` but `if (status === ORDER_STATUS.CANCELLED)`.
- Use the type system to document intent: `Optional<User>` communicates that the value may
  not exist; a generic wrapper communicates ownership or lifecycle. The type replaces
  the comment.

**Valid exceptions** — the only cases where a comment is justified:
- Public API documentation (parameters, contracts, return values).
- Origin of a non-trivial mathematical algorithm (reference to a paper or formula).
- Explanation of the *why* behind a non-obvious business decision or an anomalous and
  imperative optimization, accompanied by metrics or context external to the code.

**Naming well IS documenting.** Before writing a comment, apply one of these strategies
depending on the level:

- **Complex function:** extract the block into a function with a name that describes its
  intent. The name replaces the comment.
- **Hard-to-read conditional or expression:** assign it to a descriptively named boolean
  variable. The name explains what is being evaluated.
- **Long expression or calculation:** extract it into an intermediate variable whose name
  describes what the result represents.

```
// BAD — comment explains what the code should say on its own
if (user.age >= 18 && user.country === 'UY' && !user.isBanned) { // can vote
  allowVote();
}

// GOOD — named variable that documents the intent
const isEligibleToVote = user.age >= 18 && user.country === 'UY' && !user.isBanned;
if (isEligibleToVote) {
  allowVote();
}

// BAD — comment above a complex block
// calculate volume discount and apply regional tax
const total = applyTax(applyDiscount(price, qty), region);

// GOOD — intermediate variables that narrate the process
const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(price, qty);
const totalWithTax = applyTax(discountedPrice, region);
```

---

## 2. Name things correctly

- **Variables** must be nouns that describe exactly what they contain. Forbid generic names
  like `data`, `info`, `temp`, `val`, or single letters like `x` outside explicit mathematical
  contexts.
- **Functions** must be verbs that describe the action they perform:
  `calculateTax()`, `fetchUserProfile()`, `validateInput()`. If a function does two things,
  its name is a signal that it should be split.
- **Booleans** must read as questions: `isVisible`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`.
  Never: `flag`, `status`, `check`, `result`.
- Longer, descriptive names are almost always better than short, cryptic ones. Readability
  matters more than brevity when writing.
- Be consistent within the project: if `get` is used to retrieve data, don't mix it with
  `fetch` or `load` for the same purpose. Uniform vocabulary reduces the team's cognitive load.
- Variables representing measurable magnitudes must communicate their unit unambiguously.
  Hierarchy to follow: first use a language type if one exists (`Duration`, `Money`,
  `Distance`, `DateTime`) — the type communicates the semantics on its own. If no suitable
  type exists, include the unit explicitly in the name: `timeout_ms`, `weight_kg`,
  `distance_km`, `price_usd`.
- Generic structural terms like `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Handler`, or `Service` must
  not be used alone as a full name. If used, they must be anchored to concrete business logic
  that makes them specific: not `UserManager` but `UserSessionManager`; not `PaymentHelper`
  but `DiscountCalculatorHelper`.

---

## 3. Don't nest your code

- Limit nesting to **2 levels maximum**. More than that is a signal that the function is too
  complex and should be split.
- Apply **guard clauses / early return**: validate error conditions at the start of the
  function and return immediately. The happy path stays unnested and flows top to bottom.
- Apply **extraction**: if a nested block is complex, extract it into its own function with
  a descriptive name. Each function must have a single responsibility.
- Flat code is easier to read, test, and refactor than nested code.

```
// BAD — deep nesting
function process(data) {
  if (data) {
    if (data.user) {
      if (data.user.isActive) {
        // main logic here
      }
    }
  }
}

// GOOD — guard clauses
function process(data) {
  if (!data) return;
  if (!data.user) return;
  if (!data.user.isActive) return;
  // main logic here
}
```

## 4. Prefer composition over inheritance

- Use inheritance only when a genuine "is-a" relationship exists **and** the Liskov
  Substitution Principle holds. Don't use it just to reuse code.
- Deep inheritance hierarchies become fragile: a change in the base class can break all
  subclasses in unexpected ways.
- Favor small, specific interfaces combined through composition. The system is easier to
  reason about and easier to change in the future.
- If when modeling a class you feel the need to override or empty inherited methods, that's
  a signal that inheritance is the wrong tool.

---

## 5. Use dependency injection

- Don't instantiate dependencies inside a class. Pass them from the outside, preferably
  through the constructor. Constructor injection guarantees that the object is born complete
  and valid — never in a partially initialized state.
- Program against **abstractions** (interfaces or types), not concrete implementations.
  This decouples classes and allows swapping implementations without modifying the client.
- A class must do one thing. If it also creates its own dependencies, it's doing two things
  (Single Responsibility Principle).
- The ultimate goal of DI is **loosely coupled code**, not the pattern itself. Apply DI
  where decoupling has real value.

---

## 6. Don't optimize prematurely

- First make the code **correct and readable**. Optimize only when you have measurable
  evidence (profiling, benchmarks) of a real performance problem.
- 97% of the time, premature optimization damages maintainability with no real benefit.
  The remaining 3% — verified bottlenecks — does deserve attention.
- Code complicated for unproven performance reasons is technical debt. It makes the system
  harder to read, debug, and evolve.
- When you do optimize, prioritize improving algorithm selection and data structures —
  that solves 80% of real performance problems. CPU cycle micro-optimizations are the
  last resort, not the first.

---

## 7. Don't over-abstract

- Abstract only when you have **at least real use cases** for the same pattern. Abstracting
  earlier is speculative and creates indirection with no demonstrated value (YAGNI).
- Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction. Duplicated code can be cleanly
  refactored; a bad abstraction propagates and becomes hard to replace.
- Every layer of abstraction is a layer of indirection the reader must traverse. Always ask:
  does this level of abstraction help or hinder understanding of the system?
- The coupling generated by a wrong abstraction can be more costly than the duplication it
  aimed to eliminate.

---

## 8. Pragmatism over paradigms

- Pure functions (without side effects) are easier to reason about, test, and compose.
  Favor them when possible — but without dogmatism.
- Don't force functional structures where imperative programming or OOP is more natural and
  readable for the team.
- Immutability reduces shared state errors and makes behavior predictable under concurrency.
  Model data so it is not reassigned in memory over time where possible.
- The ultimate goal is always **readable, maintainable, and correct code**. No paradigm is
  an end in itself; all are tools in service of that goal.

## Guiding principle

> Code is written to be read by people, not just executed by machines.
> When something feels hard to name, explain, or understand, that is a design signal —
> not a signal that documentation is missing.
